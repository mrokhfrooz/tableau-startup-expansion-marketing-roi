# tableau-startup-expansion-marketing-roi
An interactive Tableau project analyzing startup expansion strategy through Marketing ROI (ROMI), revenue trends, and K-means clustering. The dashboard identifies high-potential cities for investment by evaluating marketing efficiency, revenue performance, and population data to support data-driven expansion decisions.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is attached to this repository and consists of two files:

- Startup Expansion Dataset (P1-StartupExpansion.xlsx)
- -Contains marketing and revenue data for multiple U.S. cities.

US Cities Population Dataset (P1-US-Cities-Population.csv) – Contains population data used to enrich and refine the analysis through cross-database joins.

Startup Expansion Dataset – Key Columns

City – Name of the city

State / Region – Geographic classification of the city

Marketing Spend – Amount invested in marketing

Revenue – Revenue generated from marketing efforts

ROMI (Revenue / Marketing Spend) – Calculated return on marketing investment

Population Dataset – Key Columns
